# Apu Das – Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The goal of this site is to showcase my background, technical skills, academic projects, competitive programming achievements, and professional experience in a clean and organized way. I’ve built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without any frameworks or templates — to keep it lightweight and fully under my control.

Everything from the responsive navigation bar, animated text header, and award cards to the carousel-based skills section and scroll behavior is custom-coded.
